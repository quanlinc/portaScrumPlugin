Extra features for portaScurm

Abstract:
PortaScrum does not have a copy story feature, or just say move current story to next sprint feature(not likely anyone
wants to move story to previous sprint), the current way will be puting the story back to backlog, switch to the new sprint
then pull it back in.

So this javascript plugin is going to provide some addtional feature to exhance user experience.

Note: The early version of this plugin is intended to be run using greasemonkey plugin for FireFox, Chrome version plugin will be provided in later version, should be a easy migration.


V0.1

1. Add the ability to copy unfinished story to next sprint.
  the copied story will only contain tasks that's been left over in last sprint.
2. Ability to check if there exist a new sprint that you can copy the current story to, if not, provide you the way to create one within same page.
   
   
V0.2

1. Add drag adn drop feature to allow user move tasks around stories. (need some research to see if it's doable.
